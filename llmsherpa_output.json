success.","In viviparous 2 mammals in the absence of yolk, uterine glands support the pregnancy and embryo 3 development until the placenta forms (1).","Uterine glands are present in humans, rodents, sheep, 4 pigs, and horses among other studied mammals (2).","Uteri of neonatal mice are devoid of glands 5 at birth.","At postnatal day (P) 5, gland buds protrude off the uterine lumen on the anti-6 mesometrial (AM) and lateral sides of the murine uterus and extend into the surrounding stroma 7 (3).","Glands are branched in the pubertal non-pregnant and pregnancy stages1.","Uterine glands 8 are categorized as exocrine glands, however, unlike other branched exocrine glands such as 9 salivary and mammary glands, mechanisms of uterine gland branching have not been identified 10 (4).","Uterine glands facilitate the secretions of vital factors including the key cytokine Leukemia 11 inhibitory Factor (LIF), that is essential for embryo implantation (5, 6).","While it is known that 12 exocrine gland structure contributes to function in the case of meibomian glands, mammary 13 glands and salivary glands (4), whether uterine gland structure contributes to gland secretory 14 function is not known.","15 Estrogen (E2) signaling facilitates the growth and development of the uterus as 16 suggested by various estrogen receptor deletion models.","Estrogen receptor has two isoforms, 17 ESR1 and ESR2, which are encoded by separate genes located on different chromosomes.","18 Both receptor isoforms are nuclear receptors and act as ligand-activated transcription factors 19 that can alter target gene transcription (7).","Female mice with a whole body ESR1 deletion are 20 infertile (8).","These females fail to ovulate and exhibit hypoplastic uteri that fail to display cyclic 21 changes (9).","In contrast, females with a whole body ESR2 deletion have sub-fertility with a 22 reduced litter size (8).","Mice with conditional deletion of Esr1 in different compartments have 23 been generated to highlight the cell-type-specific contributions of ESR1 signaling in the uterus.","24 Deletion of ESR1 in the neonatal epithelium, stroma and muscle, using progesterone receptor 25 driven PgrCre, and in embryonic epithelium using Wnt7aCre results in infertility (10, 11).","However, 26 implantation has not been assessed in PgrCre model and epithelial deletion of ESR1 using 27 Wnt7aCre results in protease-mediated embryo death in the oviduct (12).","Embryo transfer studies 28 into pseudopregnant uteri of the latter mice suggest that embryo implantation is not supported in 29 this model (10).","30 Gland development is variably responsive to ovarian E2 depending on the species.","In 31 the neonatal pig, gland development is both estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1)-dependent and 32 sensitive to E2 levels (13, 14).","Unlike the pig, in sheep, ESR1-inhibition does not impact gland 33 initiation (15) but reduces number of glands in the intercaruncular area, and reduces branches 34 and coils in the uterine glands (15).","In neonatal mice, the initiation of gland formation is thought 35 to be ovary-, adrenal-, and steroid-independent (16, 17).","However, treatment with Genistein (an 36 ESR1 agonist) during the neonatal period prevents gland development and results in 37 implantation failure (18).","Gland structure in Esr1-deficient mice has not been assessed.","38 Mouse mutants that display an absence of glands or key glandular secretion LIF display 39 implantation and decidualization failure (19).","Examples include mice-deficient in Wnt7a (20); 40 Foxa2 (21, 22);

secretion among these compartments presumably happens in accordance 43 with steroid hormone levels during both the mouse estrous cycle and early pregnancy (24).","44 ESR1 signaling is critical for Lif induction.","Ovulatory E2 coincides with ESR1 and Lif expression 45 in the uterus (25, 26) and prior to implantation, uterine glands express ESR1 and LIF (26).","A 46 large dose of E2 has the effect of inducing robust Lif expression, and this response is absent in 47 ESR1 knockout mice (10, 27).","However, the compartment in which Lif is expressed (luminal or 48 glandular epithelium) when stimulated by a large dose of E2 remains unknown.","Wnt7aCre 49 deletion of ESR1 results in a reduction of Lif and failed oil-mediated artificial decidualization, 50 and exogenous Lif supplementation rescues artificial decidualization in this model (11).","This 51 highlights the need for epithelial ESR1 signaling for pre-implantation Lif production in early 52 pregnancy.","53 Studies have

abrogation of ESR1 signaling and epithelial-specific 55 deletion of ESR1 result in significantly reduced mammary gland branching and consequently 56 diminished lactational function (28-30).","While the role of ESR1 signaling has been separately 57 studied during uterine development and for pre-implantation Lif expression, a connection 58 between gland structure and function is yet to be made.","In this study, we determine the 59 relationship between estrogen signaling, development of a branched gland structure and pre-60 implantation glandular LIF production.","We determine that neonatal stromal ESR1 signaling is 61 key to gland elongation and pubertal ESR1 signaling is necessary for gland branching.","We also 62 uncovered that unbranched and ESR1-deficient glands fail to

of gene 442 function in the embryonic uterine epithelium where Wnt7aCre cannot be used.","443 444 E2-ESR1 signaling and LIF production 445 LIF is an essential gland secretion that is absolutely necessary for implantation.","Lif 446 knockout mice and other genetic models that fail to produce LIF exhibit embryo implantation 447 failure.","ESR1 signaling is predicted to be upstream of Lif expression because ESR1 binding 448 sites are observed in the coding region and in the 3\u2019UTR of the Lif gene (52).","In uterine biology 449 literature, often a bolus of E2 injection results in increased levels of Lif mRNA which is usually 450 observed using whole tissue analysis such as qPCR.","Since E2-ESR1 signaling can upregulate 451 Lif in both luminal and glandular epithelium but only glandular LIF promotes embryo 452 implantation, it is necessary that these studies be interpreted carefully and the location of Lif 453 upregulation be determined when employing E2 treatment.","We observed that ovulatory E2 only 454 induces high Lif expression in the luminal epithelium, while in P4-dominant pre-implantation 455 stages, Lif is confined to the glandular epithelium.","It has been shown in various mammalian 456 species such as mice (43), hamsters (53), marmosets (54), and rabbits (55) that E2 alone is 457 unable to induce Lif expression in the glands and other factors may be necessary for LIF 458 production.","Our work suggests that in addition to E2-ESR1 signaling, branched structure of the 459 uterine gland is necessary for Lif synthesis.","Lif mRNA was negligible when uterine glands 460 lacked ESR1 signaling in addition to a branched structure or in the case of prepubertal glands 461 where although glands had E2-ESR1 signaling, glands were unbranched.","Our quantitative data 462 from both mouse models with epithelial deletion of ESR1 suggests that glands with greater than 463 three branches are key for producing threshold levels of glandular LIF to support implantation 464 resulting in pregnancy success.","We also observed that uteri with normally branched glands but 465 severely reduced ESR1 signaling were still able to produce threshold levels of LIF to support 466 embryo implantation and pregnancy success.","This indicates that gland functional ability (LIF 467 secretion and implantation) is dependent on its structure, particularly whether a gland is 468 branched or unbranched.","469 Uterine gland structure \u2013 function relationships 471 Loss of ESR1 signaling in the mammary glands results in poorly developed branched 472 structure and compromises the lactation function of the glands.","We also show that unbranched 473 glands compromise Lif secretion, resulting in implantation failure, and this phenotype is partially 474 rescued when pregnancy is supplemented with LIF. It is critical to note that supplemental LIF 475 can rescue both implantation and pregnancy, at least partially, in genetic mutants where glands 476 are branched but simply fail to produce LIF (adult epithelial ESR1 deletion, this study, and adult 477 epithelial FOXA2 deletion (22)).","However, if a genetic mutant displays failure for glands to 478 branch and fails to produce Lif, then implantation is rescued (embryonic ESR1 deletion, this 479 study and neonatal FOXA2 deletion (22, 49, 56)), but pregnancy fails to continue post-480 implantation (22).","These data support essential functions for branched uterine glands in the 481 post-implantation phase.","482 Intriguingly, mice with neonatal or adult epithelial deletion of FOXA2 displayed 483 implantation failure, but the embryos apparently entered a diapause state.","Embryos in our 484 embryonic epithelial deletion of ESR1 did not survive beyond implantation stages.","This could be 485 due to differences in the progesterone signaling in these mutant mice and will be a subject of 486 future studies.","However, even with embryos that entered diapause in FOXA2 deletion mutants, 487 viability of embryos that failed to implant was higher if glands were branched compared to bud 488 staged glands (49), supporting multiple roles for branched uterine glands beyond LIF secretion 489 and embryo implantation.","490 From our research into the structure-function relationship of uterine glands in the context 491 of pregnancy outcome, thus far we have gathered new insights regarding how uterine estrogen 492 signaling affects gland development and gland shape, and how gland structure contributes to 493 the induction of Lif and events surrounding embryo implantation.","To expand the knowledge of 494 how branched and unbranched glands differ in functional capability, further research is needed 495 to determine the secretory factors a branched gland makes and if there are specific secretory 496 cell types in uterine glands similar to mammary and salivary glands (4).","Additionally, it will be 497 useful to assess the cellular differentiation events that define how glands bud off the main 498 luminal epithelial tube and the steroid hormone dependent and independent signaling 499 mechanisms that guide gland bud elongation and branching.","Further, post-pubertal gland 500 development especially in the context of regeneration in the post menses and the post-partum 501 uterus remain understudied.","More research is therefore needed to characterize how cyclicity 502 and pregnancy remodel uterine glands and whether and how new gland buds may arise in 503 adulthood.","Gland structure-function dynamics in humans are challenging since it will be 504 necessary to assess both the basalis and the functionalis layers of endometrial glands.","505 Therefore, the mouse can provide novel insights into gland structure-function relationships 506 relevant to early pregnancy in mammals.","507 508"],"tag":"para"},{"bbox":[72.01,636.31,148.26,647.29],"block_class":"cls_3","block_idx":37,"level":2,"page_idx":13,"sentences":["CONFLICT OF INTERESTS 509"],"tag":"header"},{"bbox":[35.64,651.06,221.45,705.42],"block_class":"cls_1","block_idx":38,"level":3,"page_idx":13,"sentences":["The authors declare no conflict of interests.","510 511 512 513"],"tag":"para"},{"bbox":[35.64,70.92,542.8199999999999,264.6],"block_class":"cls_1","block_idx":39,"level":3,"page_idx":14,"sentences":["AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS 514 K.G, S.F.","and R.A. designed the experiments; K.G, S.F., M.S., J.L., A.B., and J.H.","performed 515 experiments; K.G, S.F., M.S., J.L., and R.A. analyzed the data.","K.G., S.F., X.Y., and R.A. 516 interpreted the results; K.G., S.F., and R.A. wrote the manuscript.","517 518 FUNDING 519 We acknowledge support from March of Dimes grant #5-FY20-209 and NIH R01HD109152.","520 521 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 522 We acknowledge Sameed Khan for contributing to image analysis discussions and Frank 523 Lawrence at the Center for Statistical Training and Consulting at Michigan State University for 524 help with statistical analysis.","We are also grateful to Drs.","Asgerally Fazleabas, Nataki Douglas 525 and Gregory Burns for critical analysis and research discussions.","526 527"],"tag":"para"},{"bbox":[72.0,268.02,166.55,279.0],"block_class":"cls_3","block_idx":40,"level":2,"page_idx":14,"sentences":["DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT 528"],"tag":"header"},{"bbox":[35.64,282.6,358.7,337.14],"block_class":"cls_1","block_idx":41,"level":3,"page_idx":14,"sentences":["Data generated in the manuscript is available upon reasonable request to the corresponding 529 author.","530 531 References 532"],"tag":"para"},{"bbox":[72.0,341.11,367.26,364.49999999999994],"block_class":"cls_1","block_idx":42,"level":3,"page_idx":14,"sentences":["1.
